            <p>While the Mittys’ relationship dynamic helps to characterize them as individuals, it can also be seen as a comment on how suburban life and consumer culture minimize traditional masculinity. 
                The story takes place on one of the couple’s weekly trips to town for shopping and Mrs. Mitty’s hair appointment—trips that Mitty hates because he is “always getting something wrong” on the shopping list and being scolded by Mrs. Mitty. 
                In this way, while Mitty can fantasize about commanding masculine roles, his real circumstances place him—and the modern man he represents—in service to “feminine” concerns like appearance and household care. 
                With doctors and garagemen around to take care of him, he has no opportunity nor any need to carry out heroic actions. And with traffic lights and parking garages governing his movements and Mrs. Mitty expecting him to drive her home, he has nowhere to escape but his imagination.
